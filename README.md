Downloading and running for the first time
Download everything in the main branch here on github. Then unzip the Database.zip and javazoom.zip file into the directory the rest of the program files are in. This should add Database.java, Postgres.jar, and 2 foulders META-INF and org. Then run build2.bat by doubleclicking it or typing build2 in the terminal. Check the terminal for any error messages, if none it is installed and extracted properly and you may use build, or build2 from now on.

After installing
Run either build or build2 in the terminal or by doubleclicking the file. Build2 is slower to start but ensures all files are present.
